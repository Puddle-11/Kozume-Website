                    Things I love about my girlfriend:<br><br>
                    
                    &emsp; her beautiful eyes (even though she doesnt like them)<br>
                    &emsp; her smile, the most beautiful thing in the world<br>
                    &emsp; She can turn any bad day into a great day just by being there<br>
                    &emsp; how she makes me laugh<br>
                    &emsp; how she always makes sure im ok when im feeling down<br>
                    &emsp; how she not only loves me but never makes me feel like a burden<br>
                    &emsp; her new hair! it suits her so well<br>
                    &emsp; hugging her after not seeing her for a while, best feeling ever<br>
                    &emsp; how she always talks her problems out, and never says shes ok when shes not<br>
                    &emsp; her beautiful voice<br>
                    &emsp; how entheusiastically she sings, always pours her soul out<br>
                    &emsp; her strength<br>
                    &emsp; how dedicated she is to seeing me even though its tough in college<br>
                    <br>
                    I love you alejandra
