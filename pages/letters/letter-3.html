                    You are the kindest person i know, you are patient and always do your best in our relationship.
                    You always make time for me despite your busy schedule, letting me hang out with you while you study, or work on homework.
                    I know its not always easy and I know you are working hard in college, 
                    I just want to thank you for how much you do, and how strong you always are.
                    I love you
